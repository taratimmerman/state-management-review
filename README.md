# React State Management Review

This project was inspired by this LogRocket article [How to choose the right React state management solution](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-choose-the-right-react-state-management-solution/).

## Motivation behind the project

"State management is a fundamental challenge every developer faces when building a React app â€” and it is not a trivial one. There are many valid ways to manage state in React, and each one solves a salient set of problems.

As developers, it is important not only to be aware of the different approaches, tools, and patterns, but to also understand their use cases and trade-offs." -- Iva Kop
